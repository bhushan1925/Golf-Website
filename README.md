Cursor Blur:
An intriguing cursor blur effect has been implemented. As users navigate the website, the cursor interacts with certain elements, resulting in a dynamic blur effect that adds an artistic touch to the user interface.

Background Video:
The website features a continuous background video. This video, playing seamlessly in the backdrop, provides a captivating contrast to the content presented on the site, creating a visually stunning effect.

Text elements within the website continuously scroll, drawing the user's attention to important information and updates.
When users interact with these scrolling text elements by hovering over them, the text becomes bold, making it easier to read and encouraging user engagement.![Screenshot (133)](https://github.com/bhushan1925/Golf-Website/assets/133574247/86a90450-af25-4051-9560-2060d5cfa5dd)
